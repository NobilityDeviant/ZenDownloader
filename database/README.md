# Database

These are all the series database archives.

You can create your own by downloading series, but if you want to use the new Database WIndow then you will need to download these.

They are all split by their types: Dubbed, Subbed, Movies and Cartoon.

Each of these archives must be unzipped inside the database series folder which is inside your User folder.

Example of path: `C:\Users\CuratedDev\.zen_database\series\dubbed\`

# Download Database

**Dubbed:** [dubbed.zip](https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/ZenDownloader/raw/master/database/dubbed.zip)

**Subbed:** [subbed.zip](https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/ZenDownloader/raw/master/database/subbed.zip)

**Movies:** [movies.zip](https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/ZenDownloader/raw/master/database/movies.zip)

**Cartoon:** [cartoon.zip](https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/ZenDownloader/raw/master/database/cartoon.zip)

Note: The movies database is unfinished and some entries might be completely incorrect.

I updated what I could for the movies. A lot of them didn't have any info or just are named incorrectly.
I have added an "Edit Movie" option inside the Database Window if you wish to help complete the database.

# Series Images

Most series have an image associated with them. In order to have a better experience when using the Database Window, it's advised that you also download the images.

The `series_images` folder goes inside the database folder as well.

Example of path: `C:\Users\CuratedDev\.zen_database\series_images\`
