These are all the series database archives.

You can create your own by downloading series, but if you want to use the new Database WIndow then you will need to download these.

They are all split by their types: Dubbed, Subbed, Movies and Cartoon.

Each of these archives must be unzipped inside the database series folder which is inside your User folder.

Example of path: `C:\Users\CuratedDev\.zen_database\series\dubbed\`
