# ZenDownloader

A new & fixed version of my old Wcofun Downloader made entirely with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose.

IntelliJ requires Git if using VSC on linux: https://git-scm.com/download/linux

Also requires JDK 17

Building deb requires `sudo apt-get install binutils`

Running it on linux requires Chrome.
