# ZenDownloader

A new & fixed version of my old Wcofun Downloader made entirely with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose.

It's almost ready for the public.

I will do this at my own pace, but I will finish it.
The program downloads and works great. I just want it to be public ready which includes a lot of tweaks and final touches.

Compose is a way better framework than JavaFX and fixes all the problems the old UI had.
I can guarantee a better UX. :)


TODO Before Release:

Utilize wcostream to download paywalled movies.

Finalize the color scheme and design layout for both light & dark mode.

Create a new wco database with updated series & create the cleaner UI for it.

Implement video download pausing.

Create & test distributions for Linux & Mac.
