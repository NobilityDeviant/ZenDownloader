The assets needed for the app to function properly. These will be auto downloaded at the start of the app or in between it.

# User Agents

I have realized that certain errors would occur due to the user agents I have hard coded.

Since they are ever changing, I have deicded to add them to the Asset Updater.

Users can now freely modify them, but if there's an update, it will overwrite them.

There's now new options to disable certain assets from downloading which includes user agents.
