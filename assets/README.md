The assets needed for the app to function properly. These will be auto downloaded at the start of the app or in between it.

# User Agents

I have realized that certain errors would occur due to the user agents I have hard coded.

Since they are ever changing, I have deicded to add them to the Asset Updater.

Users can now freely modify them. If there's an update, it will overwrite what you have.

If you want to disable the auto update read here: [DIsable Asset Updating](https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/ZenDownloader/tree/master/assets#disable-asset-updating)

# Wco Urls

Since wcofun changes their domain a lot, I have created a list of potential, past or current domains.

These urls will be for the apps slug system so links don't become stale or are forced to redirect.

# Movies

The movies used for wcostream. These are all scraped and formatted in a certain way for the app to read them.

If the movies.txt isn't present, then you can't download movies.

I suggest not modifying them in any way. I will update them every now and then.

# Disable Asset Updating

There's now options to disable certain assets from auto downloading at the start of the app.

Just go to Settings by pressing the Settings Tab, click the Update Options button on the bottom and disable any options related to the asset you want.

All assets will download for the first launch, but won't for the other launches.
